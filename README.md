# Library
I have built a Library webpage where i can make entries of the books I've read or amm going to read in the future.
It's something that made me use everything I've learned so far and it was quite tough. There were parts which I didn't know how to do by myself and for those I took AI's help(like light/dark toggle option) BUT I didn't copy/paste anything, I understood it the codebase and then wrote it myslef.
